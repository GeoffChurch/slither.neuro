# slither.neuro
slither.neuro is a Chrome extension that lets virtual brains play slither.io, so you don't have to! Right now it defaults to the C. Elegans connectome - in the future we should have connectome selection and customization in a settings page, as well as optional Hebbian neuroplasticity.

You may notice the worm's proclivity toward right-handed turns. Turns out, they're not ambiturners (see "Handedness of a Motor Program in C. elegans Is Independent of Left-Right Body Asymmetry" by Downes et al).
