# slither.neuro
slither.neuro is a Chrome extension that lets virtual brains play slither.io, so you don't have to!

To install this extension:

1. Clone the repo into a local directory.

2. [Enable developer mode on Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01).

3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the directory you cloned the repo into.

4. Make sure slither.neuro is enabled.

5. [slither.io](http://slither.io/)

Right now it defaults to the C. Elegans connectome - in the future we should have connectome selection and customization in a settings page, as well as optional Hebbian neuroplasticity.

You may notice the worm's proclivity toward right-handed turns. Turns out, they're not ambiturners (see "[Handedness of a Motor Program in C. elegans Is Independent of Left-Right Body Asymmetry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23300601)" by Downes et al).

The C. Elegans connectome is copied from the [GoPiGo Connectome engine](https://github.com/Connectome/GoPiGo).
